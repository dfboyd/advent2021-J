Our first goal here is to parse the ruleset into a matrix, like the
ones you use for factorio production.

Rules:

    light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
    dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
    bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
    muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
    shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
    dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
    vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
    faded blue bags contain no other bags.
    dotted black bags contain no other bags.

Parse this to get a list of bag types, and we number them:

     0  light red
     1  dark orange
     2  bright white
     3  muted yellow
     4  shiny gold
     5  dark olive
     6  vibrant plum
     7  faded blue
     8  dotted black

Now I think we make a matrix.  The first rule:

    light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.

    bag   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

    rule  1  0 _1 _2  0  0  0  0

...no, we need an adjacency matrix instead, because we're going to
complete the graph downstream by taking powers of the matrix.

    bag   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
    0	  1  0  1  2  0  0  0  0  0
    1     0  1  3  4  0  0  0  0  0
    2     0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0
    3     0  0  0  0  2  0  0  9  0
    etc.
